# Captone Project: Enhancing a Community Library Website

### Bacground Scenario

Been part of a development team tasked with enhancing the website for the "Greenwood Community Library". The website aims at be more engaging and informative for its visitors. Its currently includes basic section: Home, About US, Events, and Contact US. My team decided to add a "Book Reviews" section and update the "Events" page to feature upcoming community events.

I will simulate the roles of two contributors: "Morgan" and "Jamie". Morgan will focus on adding the "Book Reviews" section. while "Jamie" will update the "Events" page with new community events.

## Objectives

Practice cloning a repository and working with branches in git.

Gain experince in stagging, commiting, and pushing changes from both developers.

Create pull requests and merge them after resolving any potential conflicts.

## Setup

Create a repository on GitHub:
Name it greenwood-library-website.

Initialized it with a README.md file and clone it to my local machine.

## Tasks

In the main branch, using Visual Studio code editor, I will ensure there are files for each of the web pages.

about_us.html
events.html
contact.html
![File for each of the web page](./img/Files%20for%20each%20of%20the%20web%20page.png)

I will add random content into each of the files.
